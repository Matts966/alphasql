""" Workspace for Open Source ZetaSQL library """

workspace(name = "com_google_zetasql")

# Bazel doesn't support recursively loading dependencies.
# The recommended pattern is for a repo to provide a 'my_repo_deps()' method
# which will download all dependencies. Thus, a _direct dependency of 'my_repo'
# can ask it to load it dependencies. However, if 'my_repo' has dependencies
# which themselves have dependencies, and provide a 'child_repo_deps()',
# there is no way to compose a workspace such that 'my_repo_deps' calls
# 'child_repo_deps' (since this would represent a serialization of
# load-then-statement, which is forbidden).  So, we take the tactic of providing
# a serialized sequence of numbered steps that must be invoked in series to
# load all dependencies.  Copy the following code exactly into your WORKSPACE
# to fully download all dependencies. The exactly nature of what happens at
# each step may change over time (and additional steps may be added in the
# future).

# such that 'my_repo_deps'
